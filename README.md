Here is an improved, simplified, and more attractive version of your WhatsApp Chat Analyzer app code. I've organized the structure, added better comments, and cleaned up some parts for readability and style. Additionally, I've enhanced the sidebar and statistics display for a more user-friendly experience.
App Structure:
Streamlit App Code (app.py)

This file contains the main logic of the Streamlit application.
It handles file uploading, user interaction, and displays the analysis results.
Key Components:

File Uploader: Allows users to upload their WhatsApp chat data (typically a .txt file).
Preprocessing the Chat Data: The app calls functions to clean and structure the raw chat data into a more readable format, such as separating dates, times, and user messages.
User Selection: Users can choose to analyze the entire chat or select specific participants.
Statistics & Visualization: The app generates various statistics and visualizations, including:
Total messages, words, media, and links shared.
Monthly and daily activity timelines.
Activity maps (busiest days and months).
Weekly activity heatmaps.
Word clouds (most used words in the chat).
Most common words and the most active users in group chats.
Visualizations:

The app uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate charts, graphs, and heatmaps. WordClouds are used to display the most frequently used words visually.
Helper Functions (helper.py)

This file contains all the helper functions that process and generate the required statistics and visualizations.
Key Functions:

fetch_stats(): Fetches general statistics like the total number of messages, words, media files, and shared links.
most_busy_users(): Identifies the most active users in group chats.
create_wordcloud(): Generates a word cloud for a selected user or the entire chat.
most_common_words(): Identifies and counts the most frequently used words, excluding stop words.
monthly_timeline() & daily_timeline(): Create visual timelines to show activity trends over time.
week_activity_map() & month_activity_map(): Show which days of the week and months are the most active.
activity_heatmap(): Creates a heatmap showing the most active periods for each day of the week.
Preprocessor (preprocessor.py)

This file handles the cleaning and structuring of the raw WhatsApp chat data. The data is typically exported from WhatsApp as a .txt file and contains timestamps, user names, and messages.
Key Operations:

Splitting the Messages and Dates: The preprocess() function extracts dates, times, and user messages using regular expressions (regex).
Converting to DataFrame: The extracted data is stored in a DataFrame for easy manipulation.
User and Message Separation: Messages are split to identify the sender and the content.
Additional Time Features: Extra columns like year, month, day, hour, and minute are added to help with temporal analysis.
Period Calculation: The app calculates activity periods (e.g., 23:00-00:00) to help create heatmaps showing activity over time.





The WhatsApp Chat Analyzer provides an intuitive and interactive way to analyze your WhatsApp chat data. It extracts meaningful insights and presents them using various statistics and visualizations, helping users explore the activity trends, common words, and user behavior in their chats.
